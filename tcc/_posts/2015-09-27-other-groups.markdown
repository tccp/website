The Chemical and Petroleum Engineering Department has five groups ([Anna
Balazs](http://www.mirm.pitt.edu/people/bios/Balazs1.asp), [John Keith](http://klic.pitt.edu/), [Yanni
Mpourmpakis](http://www.mpourmpakis.com/home.html),
[Karl Johnson](http://puccini.che.pitt.edu/), and [Chris Wilmer](http://www.wilmerlab.com/index.php)) engaged in computational chemistry research and the Department of Computational and
Systems Biology in the Medical School also has groups ([Ivet Bahar](http://www.ccbb.pitt.edu/Faculty/bahar/index.php),
[Daniel Zuckerman](http://www.csb.pitt.edu/Faculty/zuckerman/)) part of whose research has a significant computational chemistry component.

There are also several Theoretical & Computational Chemistry groups at Pittsburgh's two other major universities –
[Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/) 
and [Duquesne University](http://www.duq.edu/) – as well as at the [DOE National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL)](http://www.netl.doe.gov/) just outside the city.
