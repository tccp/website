The Chemical and Petroleum Engineering Department has five groups ([Anna
Balazs](http://www.mirm.pitt.edu/people/bios/Balazs1.asp), [John Keith](http://klic.pitt.edu/), [Yanni
Mpourmpakis](http://www.mpourmpakis.com/home.html),
[Karl Johnson](http://puccini.che.pitt.edu/), and [Chris Wilmer](http://www.wilmerlab.com/index.php) engaged in computational chemistry research and the Department of Computational and
Systems Biology in the Medical School also has groups ([Ivet Bahar](http://www.ccbb.pitt.edu/Faculty/bahar/index.php),
[Dan Zuckerman](http://www.csb.pitt.edu/Faculty/zuckerman/)) part of whose research has a significant computational chemistry component.

There are also several Theoretical & Computational Chemistry groups at Pittsburgh's two other major universities – CMU
and Duquesne University – as well as at the [DOE National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL)](http://www.netl.doe.gov/) just outside the city.  

Joint TCC seminars are held in the [Physical Chemistry division](http://pre.chem.pitt.edu/people/physical-division), in
Chemical Engineering, the [Pittsburgh Quantum Institute](http://pqi.org), and the [Biophysics Theory
Club](http://www.csb.pitt.edu/event/biophysical-theory-club-11/). Lectures in Scientific Computing, Numerical Methods, Quantum Mechanics, Statistical Mechanics, Biophysics, Advanced Methods of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry, and many more, are offered to all theory & computation students across campus.
