The Chemical and Petroleum Engineering Department has five groups (Anna Balazs, John Keith, Yanni Mpourmpakis, Karl Johnson, and Chris Wilmer) engaged in computational chemistry research and the Department of Computational and Systems Biology in the Medical School also has groups (Ivet Bahar, Dan Zuckerman) part of whose research has a significant computational chemistry component.

There are also several Theoretical & Computational Chemistry groups at Pittsburgh's two other major universities – CMU and Duquesne University – as well as at the DOE National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) just outside the city.  

* David Wales, Cambridge University (2007)
* Kieron Burke, University of California, Irvine (2010)
* Gerhard Hummer, NIH (2010
* Fred Manby, University of Bristol (2013)
* Joost VandeVondele, University of Zurich (2015)

Joint TCC seminars are held in the Physical Chemistry division, in Chemical Engineering, the Pittsburgh Quantum Institute, and the Biophysics Theory Club. Lectures in Scientific Computing, Numerical Methods, Quantum Mechanics, Statistical Mechanics, Biophysics, Advanced Methods of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry, and many more, are offered to all theory & computation students across campus.
