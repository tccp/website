Pitt provides a stimulating environment for theory & computation researchers and students. There are strong interactions
between the various groups, and having such a large TCC "supergroup" provides many benefits including having a very
active visitors' program.

The Theoretical & Computational Chemistry community at Pitt sponsors the Henry Frank Lecture series, which brings
leading theoretical/computational chemists to Pittsburgh for three-five day stays to deliver lectures and to interact
with students, postdocs, and faculty. Joint TCC seminars are held in the Physical Chemistry division, in Chemical
Engineering, the Pittsburgh Quantum Institute, and the Biophysics Theory Club. Lectures in Scientific Computing,
Numerical Methods, Quantum Mechanics, Statistical Mechanics, Biophysics, Advanced Methods of Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry, and many more, are offered to all theory & computation students across campus.
