Students interested in theoretical and/or computational chemistry can either directly apply to a faculty member's home
department - e.g., the [Graduate Program in Chemistry](http://chem.pitt.edu/graduate), or to the 
[Computational Modeling & Simulation PhD](http://cmsp.pitt.edu/) program. The CMSP has been created to offer
students the opportunity to perform research in any of the computational groups across campus, while obtaining an
interdisciplinary education in scientific computing and algorithms.
