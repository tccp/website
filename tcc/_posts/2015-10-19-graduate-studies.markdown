Students interested in theoretical and/or computational chemistry can either directly apply to a faculty member's home
department - such as the [Graduate Program in Chemistry](http://chem.pitt.edu/graduate), or apply to the newly created
[Computational Modeling & Simulation PhD](http://cmsp.pitt.edu/) program. The CMSP has been especially created to offer
students the opportunity to perform research in any of the computational member groups across campus, combined with an
interdisciplinary education in scientific computing and modeling.
