On-campus resources are provided by the University of Pittsburgh's [Center for Simulation and Modeling (SaM)](http://www.sam.pitt.edu/).
Pittsburgh also hosts the
[Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC)](http://www.psc.edu/), an NSF-funded National Center.
PSC holds multiple workshops on various aspects of computing each year. These have proven quite valuable to our students.
