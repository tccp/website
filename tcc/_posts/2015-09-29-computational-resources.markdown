The University of Pittsburgh's Center for Simulation and Modeling (SaM) houses an ~7500 CPU core cluster with high-speed Infiniband connectivity for running demanding highly parallel calculations.  Several of the nodes have GPU co-processors.  SaM also has a team of Ph.D.-level consultants who assist researchers with improving performance of their codes and teach workshops on various aspects of scientific computing. Pittsburgh also hosts the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, an NSF-funded National Center.  PSC holds multiple workshops on various aspects of computing each year.  These have proven quite valuable to our students.
