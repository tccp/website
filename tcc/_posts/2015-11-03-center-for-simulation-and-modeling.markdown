The University of Pittsburgh's [Center for Simulation and Modeling (SaM)](http://www.sam.pitt.edu/) houses an ~7,500 CPU
core cluster with high-speed Infiniband connectivity for running demanding highly parallel calculations.  Several of the
nodes have GPU co-processors.  SaM also has a team of Ph.D.-level consultants who assist researchers with improving
performance of their codes and teach workshops on various aspects of scientific computing.
